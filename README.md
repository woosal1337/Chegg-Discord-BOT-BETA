 ### Description
 <blockquote>
"I believe that open-source resources are a must for everyone around. Especially in the field of education. As Chegg costs some money monthly, unfortunately, not all of us are capable of to charge ourselves that cost, which ends up blocking all those valuable resources to us. That is why, I have developed this bot, which unblurs the blurred question answers and sends them to you. I will develop it to a next level in the upcoming days, whereas, it will send the images/text, answers in short, directly through the Discord server you are in, or just DM/PM."
</blockquote>

### How it works
Please do not care about what is really going in the background, again, this was only purposed to supply the students with one of the biggest sources in the internet for free. Chegg is a very huge data/educational source, and blocking such big source would not be reasonable. So, just invite the bot to your sever through the link below, and use the listed as following in order to successfully retrieve your answers. Good luck, keep studying harder!

### Steps
1) Invite the BOT to your server by clicking <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=799756668111683674&permissions=8&scope=bot">here</a>
2) Add your mail to the database of the bot, so you will never ever have to mention your email again in the upcoming answer requests as exactly shown below:

```+addmail yourmail@mail.com```
